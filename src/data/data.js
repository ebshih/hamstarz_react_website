    Story_Description1: "“When I used to work in the petcare department at PetSmart, I always wondered what life is like for the little critters. Unlike dogs and cats, whom often roam free, little critters like hamsters’ world is inside a small cage.",
    Story_Description2: "I had a favorite Teddy Bear hamster at work, whom I named Hammy. He was chubby and the most adorable little thing, and I would take him out of the cage and carry him around the store whenever I could. As I was planning to adopt Hammy, while I was away from work, he was adopted by a little girl. I hope Hammy found a sweet home.",
    Story_Description3: "Hammy is the inspiration for our Hamstarz. During the creation of this collection, I imagined Hammy living his best life with his hamster friends in Hamstarzland. They could all be anything they want, including superheroes. I want to donate a portion of my sales towards hamster rescue charities, so every abandoned or neglected hamster can find a sweet home and live their best lives.”",
